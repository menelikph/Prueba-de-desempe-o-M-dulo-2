# 🌐 Personal Web Portfolio

It demonstrates proficiency in semantic structure, responsive design, modern layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid, as well as animation techniques using only CSS.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and develop a fully responsive, visually appealing, and accessible portfolio site without using any JavaScript. The page includes multiple sections commonly found in modern portfolios such as About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. Navigation between sections is implemented via anchor links.

The design adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using Media Queries. CSS Grid and Flexbox are used in combination to create layouts that are both flexible and maintainable. CSS animations are used to enhance user experience without impacting performance.
